# fir-order-comparison-ecg
Designed and simulated digital logic circuits using Verilog HDL .4th ,8th , 16th and 32nd order FIR filter were designed and testbenches were developed and functionality was verified using waveform analysis. Used Matlab to perform comparative analysis of efficiency of filters in de-nosing ECG signal
